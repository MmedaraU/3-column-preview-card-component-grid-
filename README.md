## My process
Re-did the project with Grid. I kept most of the styles from when I did the project with Flexbox but the layout is handled with Grid. Sadly, it took me some days to figure out how to center with Grid and I got to understand that I didn't completely learn how to use Grid but I'm happy I tried it out.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass/SCSS
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

Figuring out how to center with Grid was an issue at the beginning. Really happy I was able to attempt this.
